pip install h5py

copy "plot_landscape.py" to your local dir
copy "h5_util.py"        to your local dir
copy "h52vtp.py"         to your local dir

add  "from  plot_landscape import *" to the file in which you want to call the API
add these two lines to generate the landscape

	ls= landscape(net)   		#net is the trained model
	ls.generate_h5(trainloader=train_10,testloader=test_10, useTraindata= False )

	#useTraindata = True   -----slower
	#useTraindata = False  -----faster

result will be saved as "current.vtp" in  ./landscape/ dir
using "paraview" to load this vtp and view landscape
